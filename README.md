This is my tic tac toe readme.

As an avid tic toe player, I want to be able to keep track of my scores so I can improve.
As a user, I want the game to not refresh each move, so that my game is smooth.
As a frequent user, I want a sign-in method so that the game remembers me.
Day 1: Set up sign in/sign out/change password. Add simple buttons for authentication.
Day 2: Assemble the game board in HTML/CSS. 3: Make the game board interactive (response to clicks). Create new game button.
Day 4: Save score results/users
